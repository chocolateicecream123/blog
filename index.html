        <h2 style="text-align:center;">What are Disabilities?</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Disabilities can range from mental to physical disabilities, and these disabilities can hinder a person's ability to do activities or even basic human needs. Based on severity, the person may require a lot of assistance from others. While this may seem unfortunate for some, there are many research institutions and centers who specifically focus on developing treatments to support children and adults with disabilities. The next section will discuss what <b>you</b> can do to help these institutions.</p>
