        <h2 style="text-align:center;">About this Project</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">This project is dedicated to raise awareness for <b>mental disabilities</b> and <b>disorders</b> for those who are uneducated on the topic. I have chosen mental disabilities as a topic to focus on as I live with my sister who is severely affected by a syndrome that affects her day-to-day life. I was inspired to work on this project because I've always had wanted to inform others of common misconceptions of those with mental disabilities and to advocate for more opportunities for students who are dismissed because of their "limited" capabilities. As I discuss more on this topic, I will encourage you to learn more about disabilities and the ways you can contribute to assist those in need for the development of future treatments and accomodations.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">What are Disabilities?</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Disabilities can range from mental to physical disabilities, and these disabilities can hinder a person's ability to do activities or satisfy basic human needs. Based on severity, the person may require a lot of assistance from others. Because of this, there are many research institutions and centers who specifically focus on developing treatments to support children and adults with disabilities. The next few sections will discuss what <b>you</b> can do to help these institutions and their goals.</p>
