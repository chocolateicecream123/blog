        <h2 style="text-align:center;">About this Project</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">This project is dedicated to raise awareness for <b>mental disabilities</b> and <b>disorders</b> for those who are uneducated on the topic. I have chosen mental disabilities as a topic to focus on as I live with my sister who is severely affected by a syndrome that affects her day-to-day life. I was inspired to work on this project because I've always had wanted to inform others of common misconceptions of those with mental disabilities and to advocate for more opportunities for students who are dismissed because of their "limited" capabilities. As I discuss more on this topic, I will encourage you to learn more about disabilities and the ways you can contribute to assist those in need for the development of future treatments and accomodations.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">What are Disabilities?</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Disabilities can range from mental to physical disabilities, and these disabilities can hinder a person's ability to do activities or satisfy basic human needs. Based on severity, the person may require a lot of assistance from others. Because of this, there are many research institutions and centers who specifically focus on developing treatments to support children and adults with disabilities. The next few sections will discuss what <b>you</b> can do to help these institutions and their goals.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center">Organizations and Institutions</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">In the following list, you'll find quite a few organizations (including non-profits) that support persons with disabilities and other mental health conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Autism Speaks:</b> A nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting solutions for individuals with autism and their families through advocacy, support, and research.</li>
                <li><b>American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD):</b> An organization that promotes progressive policies, sound research, effective practices, and universal human rights for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</li>
                <li><b>Special Olympics:</b> This organization works to create an inclusive sports program for those who live with intellectual and mental disabilities. Check out their website <a href="https://www.specialolympics.org/get-involved/donate?locale=en">Special Olympics donation page</a> to learn more about how to donate to the organization.</li>
                <li><b>FOXG1 Research Foundation</b>: This non-profit institution works to find treatments and support for children and adults alike who have the FOXG1 syndrome. You can learn more about this syndrome at their official <a href="https://foxg1research.org/foxg1syndrome">website</a> and support by donating and signing up for their newsletter. Currently, they are hosting numerous fundraisers- one specifically for gene therapy. Get involved <b>today</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Kennedy Krieger Institute</b>: An institution that is dedicated to improving lives of those with mental disabilities. Help support their mission by visiting their <a href="https://www.kennedykrieger.org/">website</a> and learning more about the institute and ways to contribute.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Many of these institutions work hard to provide as much knowledge and accommodations as possible to the general public to support individuals with mental disabilities. Consider supporting their hardwork via their donation pages, all linked below.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">ESE Programs in Hillsborough County</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">In public schools here in Florida, many schools offer a system of education called Exceptional Student Education (ESE) for tailored school instruction for students with mental disabilities and giftedness (primarily students with an Individualized Education Program, IEP). These programs ensure education is being provided for students the most effective and appropriate way.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">My Observation in an ESE Classroom</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">In the ESE classroom, all of the core subjects are worked on. Students actively engage in academic subjects such as science, math, reading and writing. Despite the challenges, teachers ensure that students are able to engage in productive learning. Additionally, proper disciplinary actions are taken, and ESE classrooms are in resemblance to normal classrooms, showing that the ESE classroom is also there to provide life skills for these students as well. The teachers have amazing patience with their students. They will work with the students until they proficiently understand the concepts being worked on in class, even if it means sticking with one particular part of the curriculum for the student. Furthermore, the simplification of the concepts does not detract from presenting appropriately challenging assignments that can engage student thinking in the ESE classroom.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">	All in all, it was an amazing and inspiring experience to work with ESE teachers and the ESE specialist at Marshall! As of current, I come to the ESE classroom to work with students every Thursday and as many other days as possible. <i>Keep up in the loop with more information as more information is available!</i></p>
