### What is this page about?
As part of the IB World Magnet program, 8th graders are required to create an SLP project. So, in response to this project, I decided to focus on Mental Disabilities and raising awareness and research for those who have disabilities and focusing on the great future of all. More information and ways to contribute will be added over time, as I am very busy with other schoolwork also. Enjoy, and send this website to as many people as possible to spread the message.
